Density Functional Theory Methods Using Quantum Espresso [series]

This workshop series will benefit researchers who are interested in or are starting to learn about the application of theoretical methods and techniques for the study of the physics and chemistry of the solid state. These hands-on oriented workshops are targeted towards undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students who wish to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods in their research. The aim is to teach the basics of ab initio atomistic materials simulation using the Quantum Espresso suite of codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
